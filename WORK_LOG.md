| Sep 3 | 0600-0630  pom | Thinking of using recusive approach that involves finding ladder thatjumps the most spaces. Worried about case where there is a ladder from 0,40 then another from 41,100 if there is a ladder 10,70 |
| Sep 3 | 0700-0730  pm  |                          Wrote helper method which finds the lingest ladder and returns index. Wondering if I should sort my list of ladders as that would help checking the entire list every loop. |
